# My middleman starting point using Haml and Sass (scss)

Clone this project into `~/.middleman/` then change into whatever directory
you like to work from. Use `middleman init [newDirectoryName]
--template=Pickle` as illustrated in the middleman documentation.

You&rsquo;ll need [middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) installed before this will do you any good.
