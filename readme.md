# My middleman starting point

You&rsquo;ll need [middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) installed before this will do you any good.

Clone this project into ~/.middleman then change into whatever directory
you like to work from. Use `middleman init [newDirectoryName]
--template=Pickle` as illustrated in the middleman documentation.
